# Simplifying My Life with iOS Shortcuts

When I came back to iOS after years on Android, I didn’t want another folder full of novelty automations. I wanted **micro-tools** I’d use every day—under 10 seconds, hands-free when possible, and reliable.

This post covers the few that stuck: **Log an Idea**, **Log a Worry**, and a **Break Timer** that respects Focus/DND. They’re boring on purpose—and that’s why they work.

---

## Design rules that made these shortcuts stick

- **≤ 10 seconds end-to-end.** If it takes longer, I’ll forget to use it.
- **Hands-free first.** Must work via **Siri**, ideally in the car or on a walk.
- **One source of truth.** Each shortcut writes to a dedicated list so nothing gets lost.
- **Widget + Siri + Watch.** Triggers everywhere I might need them (Home Screen, lock screen, Apple Watch complications).
- **No brittle logic.** Prefer stock apps (Reminders/Notes/Calendar) over third-party dependencies.

## Shortcut 1: Log an Idea (zero-friction capture)

**Goal:** Capture ideas the moment they pop up—without opening an app or losing context.

**Why it works**
- Dictation into **Reminders** is faster than opening Notes and choosing a folder.
- An **“Ideas”** list keeps capture and review separate from daily todos.
- Timestamping avoids “what did I mean by this?” later.

**What it does**
1. Prompt for text or **dictate** via Siri: “Hey Siri, Log an Idea”.
2. Create a Reminder in a list named **Ideas**.
3. Append the current **time** (and optionally location) to the note field.
4. (Optional) Tag it `#idea` so you can build Smart Lists/filters later.

**Use it**

**Make it better**
- Add a **daily review** (Calendar event at 17:30 or a repeating Reminder) to triage ideas into tasks or notes.
- On Apple Watch, map it to a **complication** so it’s truly one tap.

## Shortcut 2: Log a Worry (CBT-style worry postponement)

**Goal:** Get intrusive worries out of your head *now* and deal with them at a specific, calmer time.

**Why it works**
- Based on a simple CBT technique: **capture now, review later**.
- Saying it out loud to Siri is often enough to reduce rumination.
- A dedicated **“Worries”** list prevents them from polluting everyday tasks.

**What it does**
1. Prompt for the worry (works with dictation in the car).
2. Add a Reminder in a list named **Worries** with your text in the note.
3. (Optional) Add a **review time** (e.g., today 19:00) so you *know* you’ll revisit it, then snooze until then.

**Use it**
- [Download ‘Log a Worry’](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/dbf4af57c2f94a32989f709bf2a00834)

**Make it better**
- Create a repeating **“Worry Review”** event at a consistent hour; batch-process and either resolve, schedule, or delete each item.
- Add a custom **tag** (e.g., `#finance`, `#health`) to cluster themes over time.

## Shortcut 3: Break Timer (Focus-aware pause button)

**Goal:** Take a real break without missing important messages—or getting spammed by everything else.

**Why it works**
- Toggle a Focus (or DND) **with exceptions** instead of going fully dark.
- The timer **automatically restores** your previous state so you can’t forget to come back.

**What it does**
1. Ask how long you want (e.g., 10/15/25 minutes).
2. Enable a **Break** Focus or DND with **Allow Notifications From** (favourites/urgent).
3. Optionally set a **Slack/Status** message if you want visible signals.
4. **Wait** for the duration, then restore your normal Focus.

> Tip: Put this on your **lock-screen widget**; if it’s two taps away, you won’t use it.

## Setup notes & troubleshooting

- **Lists:** Create **Ideas** and **Worries** in **Reminders** first (Shortcuts can do it, but doing it once manually avoids prompts).
- **Siri names:** Keep shortcut names short and unique (“Log an Idea”, “Log a Worry”, “Break Time”).
- **Widgets:** Long-press Home Screen → **Edit Home Screen** → **+** → **Shortcuts** → pick your shortcuts.
- **Apple Watch:** In the Watch app → **Complications** → add Shortcuts for single-tap use.
- **Privacy:** Dictations go wherever your default input goes; if sensitive, consider typing or disabling location stamps.
- **Reliability:** If Siri says “You’ll need to continue in the app,” add a minimal **Ask for Input** action at the start—oddly, this stabilises hands-free runs.

## When to prefer Shortcuts over dedicated apps

Shortcuts shine when the workflow is:
- **Simple** (one or two steps),
- **Frequent** (you’ll use it daily/weekly), and
- **Better hands-free** (driving, walking, or in a queue).

If you find yourself building 20-step trees, that’s a smell—consider a proper app or a different capture target.

---

## Why these survive while others don’t

- They solve **one real annoyance** each.
- They’re **fast** (no scrolling or mode-switching).
- They are **reviewable** (Ideas/Worries lists aren’t where tasks go to die).
- They’re **available everywhere** (Siri, widget, Watch).

Small automations compound. The win isn’t a single clever Shortcut—it’s the **friction you never feel again**.
