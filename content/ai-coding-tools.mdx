summary: 'How I went from early frustration with GitHub Copilot to leveraging modern AI coding tools for boilerplate, infrastructure, and workflow automation — freeing up time for real problem solving.'

I’ve gone through the hype cycle of AI coding tools — from early disappointment to genuine productivity gains — and the journey has taught me when and how these tools actually earn their keep.

### The Early Days: GitHub Copilot in VS Code
When I first tried **GitHub Copilot** inside VS Code, I wanted it to be magic. Instead, it was mostly noise. The suggestions were often irrelevant, and the time I spent correcting them outweighed any gains. It felt easier to just write the code myself.

### Cursor and Zed: Incremental Improvement
Later, I tried **Cursor** and **Zed**. Cursor, at that stage, felt like a slightly unpolished VS Code clone, but I could see potential. Zed had far more polish — fast, clean, and pleasant to use — but the underlying AI capability was still the same idea: edit text in files.

### The Breakthrough: Claude Code and OpenAI Codex
Everything changed when I started using **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex**. These tools could operate like a real assistant — moving files, running tests, executing Git commands — not just inserting text. Suddenly, AI wasn't just 'autocomplete on steroids'; it could actually *work alongside me in my dev environment*.

Over time, these capabilities made their way into Cursor and Zed, and the tool usage experience improved dramatically.

### My Rule of Thumb: AI for the Gruntwork
The biggest win for me has been **offloading anything that doesn’t feel bespoke**:
- **Boilerplate generation** — DTOs, interface stubs, config files.
- **Unit test scaffolding** — AI gets you to a good starting point quickly.
- **Build pipeline tweaks** — YAML edits, CI/CD job wiring.
- **Terraform & infrastructure scaffolding** — repetitive, rules-based work AI excels at.

The creative or business logic stays firmly in human hands. That’s the part where context, nuance, and intent matter most.

### Real Examples
Two examples from my own work:
1. The [**Pride avatar post**](/seasonal-avatar-borders) — AI handled the image transformation boilerplate while I focused on the creative concept.
2. The [**GitHub avatar sync post**](/github-image-sync) — AI automated tedious API calls and formatting while I refined the logic.

### Closing Thoughts
AI coding tools are no longer a gimmick in my workflow — but they work best when I treat them as a *junior developer who’s brilliant at repetitive work*. I delegate the gruntwork, keep the important decisions myself, and review everything before it ships.

> **Pro Tip:** Use AI to create space for deep, creative thinking. If you’re spending less time wiring boilerplate, you have more bandwidth for architecture, problem-solving, and innovation.
