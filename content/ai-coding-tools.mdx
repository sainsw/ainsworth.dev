publishedAt: '2025-08-09'
summary: 'Real-world comparison of three AI coding tools used extensively during the vibe coding transformation - their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases.'
---

## The Landscape

During the [vibe coding transformation](/blog/vibe-coding) of this site, I extensively used three different AI coding tools: **Zed Editor**, **Claude Code**, and **OpenAI Codex**. Each brought unique strengths to different aspects of the development process.

After 100+ AI-generated commits, here's an honest comparison of how these tools performed in real-world scenarios.

## üöÄ Zed Editor

Zed's AI integration focuses on contextual assistance within a lightning-fast native editor.

### Strengths
- **Blazing Performance**: Native Rust implementation with sub-millisecond response times
- **Context Awareness**: Understands entire project structure and dependencies
- **Seamless Integration**: AI feels like a natural part of the editing experience
- **Multi-file Edits**: Excellent at coordinating changes across related files
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live sharing with AI assistance for pair programming

### Weaknesses
- **Limited Reasoning**: Better at code completion than architectural decisions
- **Newer Ecosystem**: Fewer plugins and integrations compared to VS Code
- **macOS Focus**: Best experience is on macOS (though Linux support exists)

### Best Use Cases
- **Refactoring sessions** where you need quick, contextual suggestions
- **Component development** with real-time feedback
- **Performance-critical editing** where editor speed matters
- **Team collaboration** with shared AI context

*Example: Zed excelled at the SVG sprite system implementation, understanding the relationship between component files and build scripts.*

## üß† Claude Code

Claude Code offers conversational AI development with deep reasoning capabilities.

### Strengths
- **Architectural Thinking**: Excellent at system design and planning
- **Code Quality**: Generates well-structured, documented code
- **Problem Solving**: Can debug complex issues through conversation
- **Multiple Languages**: Strong across web technologies and beyond
- **Iterative Development**: Great at refining solutions based on feedback

### VS Code Integration
Claude Code offers a unique CLI-driven workflow that bridges the gap between conversation and code:

- **Command Line Interface**: Initiate conversations and edits from your terminal
- **VS Code Preview**: Proposed changes appear in VS Code windows for review
- **Approval Workflow**: Accept/reject changes before they're applied to files
- **Multi-file Operations**: Can coordinate changes across multiple files simultaneously

### Weaknesses
- **Not for CLI Haters**: Requires comfort with command-line workflows
- **Context Switching**: Still requires moving between terminal, Claude, and editor
- **File Management**: Less seamless than native IDE integrations
- **Rate Limits**: Usage caps can interrupt extended coding sessions

### Best Use Cases
- **Feature planning** and architectural decisions
- **Complex debugging** that requires reasoning
- **Code reviews** and quality improvements
- **Learning new patterns** and best practices

*Example: Claude Code designed the entire cookie consent system architecture, from GDPR compliance to Zaraz integration.*

## ü§ñ OpenAI Codex

The original AI coding assistant, now integrated into GitHub Copilot and other tools.

### Strengths
- **Broad Training**: Massive codebase training across many languages
- **IDE Integration**: Native support in VS Code, Vim, and others
- **Pattern Recognition**: Excellent at completing common coding patterns
- **Speed**: Fast suggestions with minimal latency
- **Community**: Large user base and extensive documentation

### Weaknesses
- **Less Reasoning**: Focuses on completion rather than problem-solving
- **Context Limitations**: Limited understanding of broader project goals
- **Generic Solutions**: Sometimes suggests boilerplate over optimal approaches
- **Subscription Model**: Requires GitHub Copilot or API access

### Best Use Cases
- **Rapid prototyping** where speed matters most
- **Boilerplate generation** for repetitive code
- **Learning syntax** in unfamiliar languages
- **Code completion** during regular development

*Example: Codex was perfect for generating the repetitive test cases and utility functions throughout the project.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Integration

### The Ideal Combination

Through the vibe coding process, I discovered each tool excels at different phases:

**1. Planning & Architecture** ‚Üí **Claude Code**
- Design system architecture
- Plan implementation approach  
- Identify potential issues

**2. Active Development** ‚Üí **Zed Editor**
- Fast, contextual coding
- Real-time refactoring
- Multi-file coordination

**3. Completion & Polish** ‚Üí **OpenAI Codex**
- Fill in boilerplate
- Generate test cases
- Quick syntax help

### Real Project Example

For the [GitHub avatar sync pipeline](/blog/github-image-sync):

1. **Claude Code** designed the content-hashing strategy and error handling approach
2. **Zed** handled the actual Sharp integration and file management implementation  
3. **Codex** generated the utility functions and build script integration

## üí° Key Insights

### What I Learned

**Tool Selection Matters**: Different AI tools excel at different tasks. Using the right tool for each phase dramatically improves results.

**Context is King**: Tools with better project understanding (like Zed) produce more relevant suggestions than generic completions.

**Human Oversight Essential**: All tools occasionally produce incorrect or suboptimal code. Active review and iteration is crucial.

**Workflow Adaptation**: The most effective approach was adapting my workflow to each tool's strengths rather than forcing one tool to do everything.

### Surprising Discoveries

- **Zed's speed** genuinely changed how I interact with AI suggestions
- **Claude's reasoning** often identified edge cases I would have missed
- **Codex's breadth** helped in unfamiliar domains like LaTeX generation

## üîÆ The Future

### Emerging Trends

**Multi-modal AI**: Tools are beginning to understand visual context, not just code
**Deeper Integration**: AI becoming part of the IDE rather than a separate feature  
**Specialized Models**: Domain-specific AI for frontend, backend, DevOps, etc.
**Collaborative AI**: Multiple AI models working together on complex problems

### Recommendations

**For Beginners**: Start with OpenAI Codex/GitHub Copilot for immediate productivity gains

**For Architects**: Claude Code's reasoning capabilities are invaluable for system design

**For Performance-Focused**: Zed's speed and native integration create the smoothest experience

**For Teams**: Consider tools that support collaborative AI development

- Performance/speed comparisons where measurable

## üéØ Conclusion

There's no single "best" AI coding tool - each excels in different scenarios. The most productive approach is understanding each tool's strengths and building a workflow that leverages them effectively.

The [100+ commits of vibe coding](/blog/vibe-coding) wouldn't have been possible with just one tool. It was the combination of Claude's reasoning, Zed's speed, and Codex's breadth that enabled such comprehensive improvements.

As AI coding tools continue evolving rapidly, the key is staying adaptable and experimenting with new approaches. The tools that seem cutting-edge today will likely feel primitive in just a few months.
